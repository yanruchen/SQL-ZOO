1. List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'.
   world(name, continent, area, population, gdp)
   
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE population >
     (SELECT population FROM world
      WHERE name='Russia')
      
2. Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.
    
select name from world
where (gdp/population) >
 (select (gdp/population) from world
  where name = 'United Kingdom')
and continent = 'Europe'

3. List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.

select name, continent 
from world
where continent =
(select continent 
from world
where name = 'Australia')
or
continent =
(select continent 
from world
where name = 'Argentina')
order by name

4. Which country has a population that is more than United Kingom but less than Germany? Show the name and the population.

select name, population
from world
where population >
(select population
from world
where name = 'United Kingdom')
and
population <
(select population
from world
where name = 'Germany')

5. Germany (population 80 million) has the largest population of the countries in Europe. Austria (population 8.5 million) has 11% of the population of Germany.

Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.

select name, concat(ROUND((population/(select population from world where name = 'Germany'))*100,0),'%') as percentage
from world
where continent = 'Europe'

** Produced trailing zeros

6. Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)

select name
from world 
where gdp > 
(select max(gdp)
from world
where continent = 'Europe')

7. Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area: (correlated/ synchronized sub-query)

SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
  WHERE area >= ALL
    (SELECT area FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND area>0)
          
8. List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically

select continent, name
from world x
where x.name <= all(
select name
from world y
where x.continent = y.continent)

9. Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.

select name, continent, population
from world x
where 25000000 >= all
(select population
from world y
where x.continent = y.continent)

10. Some countries have populations more than three times that of all of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.

select x.name, x.continent
from world x
where x.population > all
(select 3*population
from world y
where x.continent = y.continent
and x.name != y.name)
